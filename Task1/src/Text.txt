Glasgow is the third largest city of Great Britain. You may feel its industrial energy everywhere in the city.
The city extends along both banks of the river Clyde. With each phase of its development it has stretched,
until its outskirts now lie several miles from the city centre. It is, by far, the largest and most populous city
in the whole of Scotland. Glasgow is known the world over for its ship-building. Glasgow-built locomotives run
in every part of the world. Today Glasgow is of such a size that it extends far over both banks of the river Clyde
and bridges are as essential for the conduct of activities as are the people themselves. Within a distance of a mile
there are seven bridges. They carry road and rail traffic in and out of the city. No other city of Scotland has or needs
as many river crossings as Glasgow.
